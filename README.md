**MATLAB Interactive App Development Project**

*Objective*

This project involved collaborating with a group to develop an interactive MATLAB application focused on addressing the NAE Grand Challenge of providing access to clean water. The app aimed to educate users about the critical issues surrounding water quality and access, including the effects on human health, the global population, and the environment. The app also explored solutions like distillation machines and reclamation facilities to improve water access.

*Skills Learned*

-Collaborating effectively with a team to develop and design an interactive MATLAB application.

-Writing code to create interactive visualizations that allow users to explore various water-related scenarios.

-Analyzing the environmental impact of freshwater use and exploring potential solutions like distillation and reclamation.

-Modeling and simulating the effects of unsafe water and lack of clean water access on global populations.

-Developing interactive features to educate users about the importance of water quality in maintaining human health.

*Topics Covered in the App*

Effects of Water Quality/Access on Human Health: How poor water quality and limited access can lead to serious health issues.

Effect of Unsafe Water on the Global Population: The global impact of unsafe water on communities and populations.

Effects of Lack of Access to Clean Water: How lack of clean water access affects both individuals and societies.

Freshwater Use and Stress: Examining the strain on freshwater resources and its effects on ecosystems and communities.

Distillation Machines: Exploring the role of distillation in providing clean water.

Reclamation Facilities: The importance of water reclamation in improving water accessibility.

*Tools Used*

MATLAB App Designer: For building the interactive app and creating a user-friendly interface.

MATLAB Programming: For implementing simulations, analyzing data, and providing insights on water-related challenges.
